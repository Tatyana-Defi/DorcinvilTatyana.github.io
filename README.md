This repository hosts my GitHub Pages site for Assignment 3 in CAP 6930 (Tools for Production ML Systems) at Florida Atlantic University. The live site contains my blog post exploring data-quality validation using a Great-Expectations–style workflow applied to an anime dataset.

## About the Blog
The blog walks through:
- Why data quality matters in production ML systems  
- How I implemented lightweight Great Expectations–style checks in Python  
- Clean data validation results  
- Simulated production data corruption  
- Strengths, limitations, and lessons learned  

Screenshots, logs, and supporting evidence are included directly on the blog page.
